# Kanban Board

This project is a Kanban Board, meticulously crafted with the powerful combination of Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Zustand, and custom hooks. Originally sourced from Front-End Mentor, this Kanban Board project was adopted with the primary goal of honing development skills and gaining practical experience.

As of now, this Kanban Board primarily serves personal useâ€”a digital canvas for organizing tasks and projects. However, the project's roadmap includes plans for expansion, which will introduce user authentication features and various other enhancements in the future.

### Prerequisites

This project utilizes a backend API hosted in a separate repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/HpatricioH/Kanban-task-management). At present, the API does not support user authentication features; its primary purpose has been for personal use.

### Continued development

For continued development, I will be adding more features to this project. Currently, I am working on incorporating user authentication features. Additionally, there are other parts of the project that will require refactoring, as well as the inclusion of additional features.
